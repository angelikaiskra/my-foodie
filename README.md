## Installing / Developing

```shell
npm install
```

This will install the dependencies required to run the project.

```shell
npm run dev
```

The default PORTS are:

- `3001` for the server
- `3000` for the client

## Building

To build the project, run:

```shell
npm run build
```

This will build the client and server.

```shell
npm start
```

In production, you have a single server serving everything.

`/api/*` is the API endpoint.  
`/*` is the client.
